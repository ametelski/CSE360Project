The names are getting me confused and I constantly lose track of the names of the objects.
I think we should adapt a naming standard. One that I have used in the past is to name every widget with a descriptive name at the beginning.

Button - btn
EditText - et
TextView - tv
Checkbox - chk
RadioButton - rb
ToggleButton - tb
Spinner - spn
Menu - mnu
ListView - lv
GalleryView - gv
LinearLayout -ll
RelativeLayout - rl

Button btnStart = new Button();
JFormattedTextField ftxtPlayers = new JFormattedTextField(createFormatter("##"));

Also I think we should name class variables with a leading _. I have found it to be helpful when keeping track of class variables versus outside parameters.

class Node
{
private:
     int _key;
     Node* _left;
     Node* _right;

public:
     Node(int key, Node* left, Node* right)
     {
          _key = key;
          _left = left;
          _right = right;
     }
}

Let me know what you guys think.
